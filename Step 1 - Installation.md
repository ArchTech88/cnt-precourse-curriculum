# Step 1: Installation

## Git

Ensure that you have installed Git.  See https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ for help.

To check if git is installed correctly run `git version`.  It should print something like:

```
git version 2.10.1
```

If you are on a Mac, consider using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and running `brew install git`.

## Java

Ensure that you have Java 8 JDK.  See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html for help.

To check if Java 8 is installed correctly, run `java -version`.  It should print something like:

```
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed mode)
```
